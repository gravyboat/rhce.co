RHCSA requirements state that you must know how to use grep to analyze text. This is actually going to be pretty necessary to do many administration tasks on a daily basis.

Grep returns any lines that have characters, words, or expressions that match your query.

Basic usage examples of this include:

Find "Permission Denied" entries in a log file:

 <code>$ grep -r "Permission Denied" /path/to/logfile/</code>

Find "Permission Denied" entries in a log file by using output redirection:

 <code>$ cat /path/to/file/ | grep "Permission Denied"</code>
